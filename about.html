     <p> Hi everyone,</p>
    <p> My name is Yupei Duan, and I’m currently a Ph.D. student in the School of Information Science and Learning Technologies (SISLT) at the University of Missouri. </p>
   
    <p> Two years ago, before starting my Ph.D. program, I worked as a middle school biology and science teacher, as well as an administrator in China. During that time, I discovered the tremendous potential of technology to help students learn more effectively and efficiently. Since beginning my Ph.D. studies, I have been exploring how <strong>Virtual Reality</strong> and <strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong> can support <strong>STEM learning</strong>. </p>

    <p> In my instructional design work, I often incorporate game-based methods to increase the joy and engagement of learning. I hope to become both a qualified researcher and a supportive educator, helping more learners enjoy and succeed in STEM education with the aid of technology. </p>
